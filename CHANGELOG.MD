# Changed in this release

* **Improve archive version detection**: Improve archive version detection to match the file extension instead of whole name. This helps decrypting games that have a renamed archive, for example Pokemon Uranium with a renamed archive "Uranium.rgssad". Thanks @POPOharicot for reporting this issue!
